# Parkinson-Disease-Detection-using-ML
 Parkinson’s Disease is a neurological disorder affecting movement, causing tremors, stiffness, and coordination issues. Early detection is vital for effective management and improving patient quality of life. This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze voice patterns, helping to detect Parkinson’s Disease through vocal features.
