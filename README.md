# Parkinson’s Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Parkinson’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects motor functions. Early diagnosis can significantly improve the management and treatment of the disease, allowing for better outcomes. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the presence of Parkinson’s disease based on a set of biomedical voice measurements, which are commonly affected in patients suffering from the condition.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains 24 attributes related to voice recordings of individuals, including features such as:
- **MDVP (Mean, Maximum, and Minimum Frequency)**: Measures the fundamental frequency of the voice.
- **Jitter and Shimmer**: Indicators of vocal fold irregularities.
- **Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR)**: Represents the ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice signal.
- Additional features related to voice amplitude and variability.

The target variable is a binary indicator specifying whether or not the individual has Parkinson’s disease.

### Project Workflow
The project follows a structured machine learning workflow, including:

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Visualizing the distribution of features and understanding their relationships with the target variable.
   - Identifying any trends or patterns in vocal attributes that correlate with Parkinson’s disease.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Ensuring data completeness by addressing any missing entries.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Standardizing the features to bring them to a uniform scale, crucial for algorithms like SVM and KNN.
   - **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most relevant features that contribute to predicting Parkinson’s disease for improved model performance.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Implementing and training multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces for classification tasks.
     - **Random Forest**: A powerful ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs.
     - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple yet effective classification algorithm based on proximity in feature space.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the models.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score** to ensure balanced evaluation across all aspects of classification.
   - Comparison of model performance to select the best approach for this task.

5. **Final Model Deployment**:
   - Selecting the best-performing model for deployment in potential healthcare applications that can assist medical professionals in diagnosing Parkinson’s disease.

### Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to build an efficient machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the likelihood of Parkinson’s disease based on voice measurements. By identifying patterns in vocal features, the model can provide early insights that may assist in medical diagnostics.

This project demonstrates the intersection of healthcare and machine learning, showcasing the potential of data-driven solutions in enhancing early diagnosis and improving patient care.

### Technologies and Tools Used:
- **Python**: For data processing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and exploratory analysis.

### Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of how machine learning can be applied to healthcare data to solve real-world problems. By predicting Parkinson’s disease with accuracy, this approach highlights the potential of machine learning in early detection, which can greatly impact the treatment and management of patients.
